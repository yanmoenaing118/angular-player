WEBVTT

00:00:17.244 --> 00:00:20.092
The moment the sky crumbles and earth splits open

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:23.428
I open my eyes once everything has collapsed

00:00:23.428 --> 00:00:26.000
With nowhere to rest my soul

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.568
I can only start falling

00:00:30.618 --> 00:00:33.922
If only our souls could unite between heaven and earth

00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:36.982
Watching that eternal vow of love, I suddenly realise

00:00:36.982 --> 00:00:43.191
I don’t have the strength to endure a world without you

00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:46.500
When I've finally cut my emotions and bid this love farewell

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.143
The warmth of our intertwined fingertips

00:00:50.143 --> 00:00:55.419
Turned into a sharp sword, stabbing me

00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:57.642
Parting with this love

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.278
Blurs distance and time

00:01:01.278 --> 00:01:04.804
It could even suspend time

00:01:04.804 --> 00:01:08.781
Everything is just for you

00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:11.179
I'm certain

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:14.815
You're the only one in my heart

00:01:15.228 --> 00:01:18.490
It's too late to say goodbye

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.738
The regrets I'm unable to voice

00:01:22.738 --> 00:01:24.446
It's too late

00:01:38.162 --> 00:01:41.720
If only our souls could unite between heaven and earth

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.286
Watching that eternal vow of love, I suddenly realise

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.684
I don’t have the strength to endure a world without you

00:01:51.252 --> 00:01:54.471
When I've finally cut my emotions and bid this love farewell

00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:57.913
The warmth of our intertwined fingertips

00:01:57.913 --> 00:02:03.274
Turned into a sharp sword, stabbing me

00:02:03.454 --> 00:02:05.400
Parting with this love

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.054
Blurs distance and time

00:02:09.054 --> 00:02:12.422
It could even suspend time

00:02:12.422 --> 00:02:16.590
Everything is just for you

00:02:17.063 --> 00:02:18.978
I'm certain

00:02:18.978 --> 00:02:22.372
You're the only one in my heart

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.867
It's too late to say goodbye

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.226
The regrets I'm unable to voice

00:02:30.385 --> 00:02:34.134
It's too late

00:02:44.127 --> 00:02:47.919
It's too late

00:02:57.316 --> 00:03:01.723
I’ve bid farewell to this love, forever
